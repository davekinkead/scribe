# Scribe. It's Simple.

Scribe is a super simple pseudo-static site generator.

Just create a page in markdown, then push it to [github](posts/scribe-on-github-pages), your server, S3, or dropbox account.

That's it. No building or compiling necessary.  Sweet eh?

Checkout the [hello world](posts/hello-world) post to see it in action.
